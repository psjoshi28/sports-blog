                    <h2>India win SAFF Championship for 8th time; Sunil Chhetri equals Messi with 800 goals</h2>
                    <h4>India crushed Nepal 3-0 to win their eighth SAFF Championship title after second-half goals from Sunil Chhetri, Suresh Singh and Sahal Abdul Samad in the final</h4>

                <p>India crushed Nepal 3-0 to win their eighth SAFF Championship title after second-half goals from Sunil Chhetri, Suresh Singh and Sahal Abdul Samad in the final on Saturday. Chhetri scored in the 49th minute of the match, which put him level with Lionel Messi on 80 international goals, while Suresh Singh doubled the lead in the 50th to pave the way for India's title triumph, a much-needed after a series of mediocre outings. Sahal Abdul Samad made it 3-0 when he dribbled past a few defenders on the 90th minute.</p>
                <p>India dominated possession in the first-half but failed to break the deadlock. However, Chhetri put India ahead minutes into the second half and even before Nepal could down settle down, Suresh made it 2-0. This is the Indian football team's first title triumph under head coach Igor Stimac, who faced criticism in recent times for his side's inability to win enough games.</p>
                <p>India could have gone ahead minutes before the half-time but the ball that was delivered from the right flank for Chhetri was not met with properly as the Indian captain's his effort went wide. However, India more than made up for that with their second-half display, much to Stimac's delight.</p>
